//! # Dex Tools: High-Performance Solana DEX Toolkit
//!
//! `solana-dex-tools` is a high-performance, thread-safe, generic Rust library designed for developers building sophisticated high-frequency-trading (HFT) 
//! applications on the Solana blockchain. We provide utilities to use the `solana-sdk` and `tokio` ecosystems, but consumers using specialised toolkits 
//! are given the freedom to do so with our abstractions.
